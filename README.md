Purpose
===


ALEPH is a Windows rootkit designed to be configurable, powerful, and very hard to detect. The purpose of this project is merely for fun and learning, but also possibly to design a novel security testing tool.

ALEPH is released under GNU GPL (see license.txt) and specifically for legitimate security testing use for penetration testers, malware analysts, and other security professionals. ALEPH is not a hacking tool and not intended for malicious use.
